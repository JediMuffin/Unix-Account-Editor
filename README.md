# Unix-Account-Editor
Since the UNIX Account tab has already been deprecated from the ADUC on Windows Server 2012 R2 and above,
The UNIX-Account-Editor is a nifty tool you can use that works the same way.

You can stick with using the attribute editor if you like; the purpose of this tool was to help
delegate tasks to non-technical users.

PS. I like to make use of a script by Damien VAN ROBAEYS from gallery.technet.microsoft.com to convert the PS1 to EXE:
